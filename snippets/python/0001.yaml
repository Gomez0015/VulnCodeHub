# VULN NAME
name: Python MySQL SQLi

# VULN CWE ID
cwe: 89

# VULN DESCRIPTION
description: |
  SQL injections in Python occur by building queries by hand, using raw strings. When users build their queries manually, there is a high chance of introducing SQL injections.
  This occurs when using the database modules directly. For example, if you are using the mysql module, use the following code, you may be vulnerable to a MySQL injection attack by not sanitizing or checking the customer_id value.

# VULN CODE SNIPPET
code: |
  import mysql.connector

  def get_user(customer_id):
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(...)
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    mycursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id={customer_id}")
    ...
